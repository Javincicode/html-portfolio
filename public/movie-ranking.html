<h1>The Best Movies according to Javin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>A man called Otto</h3>
<p>This is my favorite thriller, Tom Hanks was at his best.</p>
<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>Forgive me, but I have a Tom Hanks bias. Once again a truly inspiring movie.</p>
<h3>Lucy</h3>
<p>my all time favorite sci-fi movie, Scarlet Johansen did justice to her role,
    plus the plot was well crafted.</p>
